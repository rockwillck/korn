    <h1>Korn Contribution Guide</h1>
	<p>Thank you for considering contributing to Korn!</p>
	<p>There are two ways to contribute:</p>
	<ol>
		<li>Write a story from scratch for korn</li>
		<li>Format an already written story</li>
	</ol>
	<h2>Formatting a story</h2>
	<p>korn uses stories to teach korean by starting with a completely english story, and slowly substituting in korean words until the reader is reading a completely korean story.</p>
	<p>Stories are formatted with a very simple markdown syntax:</p>
	<p>Whenever you want to substitute a term, replace it with [term | substitution | incorrect | incorrect | ...]</p>
	<p>For example, the sentence "Edward Drynsdale was confused. Confused about life." could be formatted as "Edward Drynsdale was confused. Confused about [ì‚¶ | life | love | family]."</p>
	<p>Stories should start with only a few words substituted and by the end, be almost completely substituted words.</p>
	<p>Stories that need to be formatted can be found <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1VRXz_I7HlfaaMHerbC9chMSLUPjxkxvbPfoumNgcots/edit?usp=sharing">here</a>.</p>
	<p>Once you've formatted a story, just submit it <a href="https://forms.gle/eLSpx5kykszj4jZx6">here</a>.</p>
	<h2>writing a story</h2>
